# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game is played entirely in the browser, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows the user to play against the computer, and the game continues until one player reaches 5 points.

## Project Overview

The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors pits the user against the computer. Each player selects one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game continues until either the player or the computer scores 5 points. Once this happens, the winner is displayed. The results, scores, and the outcome of each round are shown on the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Browser-Based Gameplay**: The game is played directly in the browser, with buttons for user interaction (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- **Continuous Play**: The game continues until one of the players (human or computer) reaches 5 points. The player can see the current score after each round.
- **Real-Time Score Update**: The score for both the player and the computer is updated after each round, and the winner is displayed once a player reaches 5 points.
